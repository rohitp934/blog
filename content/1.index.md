#### *rohitp934*
Hi, I'm Rohit! I'm 24 rn and about to pursue a master's in CS at NYU 💜

I love learning new programming languages and making cool shit. Currently learning the **crab language** **🦀** (🤐), **OCaml** 🐪, and **Go** (recently).

I'm writing an interpreter in 🦀 called [***mirame***](https://github.com/rohitp934/mirame) based on Thorsten Ball's [*interpreter book*](https://interpreterbook.com/).
